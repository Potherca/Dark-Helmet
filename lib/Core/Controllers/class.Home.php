	 * This controller provides the most basic functionality for this tool.
	 *
	 * It enables a user to log work to a TimeLog, adding entries for as long as
	 * the session stays alive. All by itself it does not know of any tags or
	 * previous state other than the current session.
	 *
	 * To be able to add support for tags, (local) storage and/or a history,
	 * several Connectors need to be registered to the tool in the settings.xml.
	 *
	 * @NOTE: At this point it untested whether or not the sessions hold beyond midnight.
