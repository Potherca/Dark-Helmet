#Once upon a time warp in deep space, the struggle between the nice & the rotten goes on...
Or to be more precise, the struggle between Those Who Want To Get Things Done & Those Who Want To Know How Long It Took Them... 

## Intended Use
This tool is meant as a web-based interface to let you log your time with as little hassle as possible. The main difference with most other timers is that it asks you what you are going to do next, instead of what you have just done.

The logging syntax takes a tag-based approach, where a tag can be prefixed with a specific symbol to denote a different function for that tag (task, project, category, ticket, etc).

## Premise
It is set up in such a manner that it should be fairly straightforward to write connectors to your favourite ticket or tracking tools. It was born mostly out of the desire to have one single interface, no matter what tool the data had to go to or come from.

Written with PHP, jQuery, HTML, CSS it tries to use existing project over creating it's own code for all but application-specific behaviour.

So yeah... footprint could be smaller and dependencies less.
